# GraphQL API :sparkles:

In this project at Holberton, we will create an application using a query language, designed to make APIs fast, flexible and developer-friendly. In the first part, we will create the back-end part using ExpressJs and set up GraphQl with all the parts (schema, root query and resolve function). In second part, we will connect our back-end to mongoDB and test our queries to GraphQL server using Graphiql. In the last part, we will create the front-end part using ReactJS and the GraphQL Client Apollo.

## Learning Objectives:

- What GraphQL means
- What is Graphiql
- How to test queries using Graphiql
- What is Apollo
- How to connect to mongoDB
- How to make queries from React
- How to make GraphQL server accept request from another server
